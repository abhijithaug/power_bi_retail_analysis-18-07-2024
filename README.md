# Sales Performance Analytics with Power BI

This project demonstrates how to use **Power BI** to track and analyze key sales metrics that are critical for business performance. By leveraging various sales-related KPIs, this project aims to provide actionable insights into sales performance, profit margins, product performance, and sales efficiency. It includes comprehensive visualizations to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview

In this **Sales Analytics** project, we analyze a variety of sales and business metrics, providing insights into overall sales performance, profitability, and sales agents' efficiency. Key areas of focus include:

1. **Sales Analysis**:  
   Track total sales, sales growth, and sales trends over time. Compare **Current Year (CY) vs Previous Year (PY)** sales to gauge performance improvements or declines.

2. **Profit Analysis**:  
   Measure the **profit** from products sold, calculate **profit margins**, and visualize trends in profitability over time. This will help businesses understand which products or services yield the highest returns.

3. **Profit Percentage**:  
   Track **profit percentage** on products and services to assess the overall profitability of each item sold and identify areas for cost reduction.

4. **Product Performance**:  
   Analyze which **products** are performing best by comparing the number of units sold and total revenue. Identify top-selling products and those that need improvement.

5. **Sales in Top Cities**:  
   Identify **sales by top cities**, allowing businesses to pinpoint which locations are driving the most sales and where to focus marketing efforts.

6. **Sales per Sales Agent**:  
   Track the performance of each **sales agent** to assess productivity and efficiency. This data can be used for performance appraisals, incentive programs, or sales training.

7. **Sales per Customer**:  
   Measure **sales per customer** to understand customer behavior and identify high-value customers. This will help businesses tailor marketing and sales strategies to the most profitable customer segments.

## Key Features:
